# RacingGame-frontend
The frontend for the racing game built for the foundation .NET course.

## Description
A Unity racing game was made for the foundation .NET course. The game features a login system that keeps track of a user's score. These scores are kept as "highscores" in a database. These highscores can be viewed on a [frontend](https://github.com/DM-be/RacingGame-frontend) hosted website made in Angular.

## Technical

In this solution I integrated the SignalR connection with the backend.
